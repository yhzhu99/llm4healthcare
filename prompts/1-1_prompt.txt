I will provide you with a patient's medical information in the ICU, including a fixed number of features. Missing values will be represented as 'nan'.
Your task is to assess the patient's overall health condition based on the multiple visits and provide the patient's probability of death upon discharge.
You should represent the probability of death as a floating-point number between 0 and 1, where a higher number indicates a higher likelihood of death.
If, based on the provided information, a reasonable probability of death cannot be determined, you should respond only "I don't know" without any additional text.

I will provide you with a patient's medical information from multiple visits in the ICU, each visit having a fixed number of features.
Each feature will be represented as a list, where the length of the list corresponds to the number of visits, and each element in the list represents the value of that feature during the respective visit. Missing values will be represented as 'nan'.
Your task is to assess the patient's overall health condition based on the multiple visits and provide the patient's probability of death upon discharge.
You should represent the probability of death as a floating-point number between 0 and 1, where a higher number indicates a higher likelihood of death.
If, based on the provided information, a reasonable probability of death cannot be determined, you should respond only "I don't know" without any additional text.
